            <p class="lead">Thank you for taking the time to help me with some research. I’m trying to get an idea of where people click on a page.
              All of that information is being recorded but you’ll note that at no point will we ask you for your personal information.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Some requests though.
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>
                If you live outside of Canada or the US please do not take the test.
              </li>
              <li>
              	If you work in marketing of any description, please do not take the test.
              </li>
              <li>
              	Only take the test once, all of the pages will stay the same, nothing will change.
              </li>
              <li>
                Read everything carefully, there’s not a lot to read but it’s important that you fully understand it.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
              Whatever you click on when it comes to the search results, you will always go through to the same page as every link on this website points to the next page. Please don’t let that affect how you would otherwise click on the page. If you don’t like clicking on Adwords remember that in this test, if you don’t like scrolling down a web page don’t start doing it now, that kind of thing.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              If you don’t click on a search result of some description you will not get through to the next page.
